## Game Description

### Objective

The goal of our game is to open a path of empty spaces between opposite sides with the same color without opening a similar route between the sides with the enemy color.

### Game Board

The gameboard is an 8x8 board or 6x6 for beginners and faster games.

The red player owns the top and bottom edges while the blue player owns the left and right ones.

The corner between edges is part of both sides.

### Game Start

At the start of the game, all the pieces are inside the board. Their position is in such a pattern that there are no orthogonally adjacent pieces from the same player.

The starting player is red. 

### Rules

The turns alter, and the players move alternately.

When it is their turn, the player should move one of his pieces, capturing an enemy one, either horizontally adjacent or vertically adjacent, and leaving his in that spot.

If possible, the player is forced to capture enemy pieces. However, when that is no longer possible, the player removes one of his own.

### Win Conditions

The only way to win is to connect orthogonally (horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally) adjacent empty squares to form a path between the player's edges without forming a similar route between the enemy's sides.

If a player opens a path between his edges in the same move/turn as a path between the enemy's sides, he loses.

There are no draws.

## Internal Game State
The current game state is composed of the Dimensions of the board, the Board itself and the number of captured pieces from both players. It is a complex member impleted as "Dimensions-Board-CapturedPieces".

### Board Representation
The game board ("Board" in the complex member representing the Game State) is a list of lists
forming a square matrix of dimension "Dimensions" (present in the member Game State).

In this matrix each cell represents a cell of the board and they can have one of three values: a space (" ") representing an empty cell of the board, a upper case "x" ("X") representing a board cell ocupied by a piece of the red player, a upper case "o" ("O") representing a board cell ocupied by a piece of the blue player.

### Current Player
The Game State is normally acompanied by the player on the move wich can either be "red" or "blue".

### Captured Pieces
The Captured Pieces are represented by a list with two elements that work as counters.

The first being the number of pieces captured by the "red" player and the second one being the number of pieces captured by the "blue" player

## Representation Examples

### Meaning of Piece Representation
Pieces represented with an "X" belong to the "red" player and pieces represented with an "O" belong to the "blue" player.

## Game Visualization
The presentation of the game is handled by the predicate display_game/2.

This predicate prints on the screen the player on the move, the pieces that have been captured so far and the current game board.

The game board is the more complex. To print it, the predicate display_game uses some auxliary predicates that parse the list of lists that represent the board internally. These predicates go through each element of the main list, these being equivalent to the lines of the board, printing each symbol of each cell on the screen; every symbol of a board line is printed on the same screen line and each board line is printed on a separed screen line.

During the board printing processes some minor auxiliary predicates are used to create divides in the form of spaces (" "), slashes ("|") and hifens ("-"). These help in the readbillity of the board once printed on the screen.
