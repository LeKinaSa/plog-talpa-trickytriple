In this article, we show how to use constraint programming to solve Tricky Triple Puzzles.
We present a consistent method to analyze these puzzles and to obtain a solution to them.

\section{Introduction}
This project consists of building a program, in Logic Programming with Restrictions,
    for solving a combinatorial decision.
The problems studied are Tricky Triple Puzzles, which are grid puzzles. 
To do so, we will analyze these problems and proceed to implement our solver using SICStus Prolog.
Afterward, we will be discussing the performance results obtained.

\section{Problem Description}
The Tricky Triple puzzles are a type of grid puzzle.
The goal of the puzzle is to fill each of the grid’s white cells with one of 3 symbols,
a square, a circle, or a triangle.
The only rule is that each group of 3 adjacent white cells
    (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) must contain exactly 2 of one of the symbols.
So, each group of 3 white cells will have 2 of 3 symbols.
Each puzzle given has a unique solution.

\section{Approach}
Throughout the development of this project, we used a Constraint Logic Programming approach.
Our board is a list of lists, where each element is a number indicating the symbol placed on that cell.
Each one of these numbers represents a different symbol.
The number 0 represents a black cell, which cannot be generated by the solver.
The number 1 represents a green triangle,
    while the number 2 represents a red square and the number 3 a blue circle.

\subsection{Decision Variables}
All triple tricky puzzles take the form of a NxN square grid divided by cells, this is
represented internally by a square matrix form by a list of lists.

The grid cells can either be black, a cell that can't be filled, or, more commonly, white.

The white cells need to be filled with either a triangle (represented by 1), a square (represented by 2)
or a circle (represented by 3) to reach the puzzle solution.

The Decision Variables are all the elements of the list of lists, meaning all the puzzle cells.
Their domain is {0, 1, 2, 3}. The zero is representative of a black cell and for our solver
is not considered as a valid value to put on a cell, this is guaranteed by a restriction,
because that would make a white cell into a black cell.  

\subsection{Constraints}
The restrictions implemented in our solver are faithful to the ones from the puzzle rules.

\textbf{Each cell must contain a symbol} \\
In the puzzle solution, all the cells have to be assigned.

\textbf{No black cells can be assigned} \\
In every white cell, we need to put a square, a triangle, or a circle.
Meaning we can't put a black cell on a white cell.

\textbf{Each group of 3 adjacent white cells (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
    must contain exactly 2 of one of the symbols} \\
Consider a group of three adjacent, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, white cells.
In this group, two of the cells have the same symbol, and the last cell must have a different one.

\section{Section Sample}
\subsection{A Subsection Sample}
Please note that the first paragraph of a section or subsection is
not indented. The first paragraph that follows a table, figure,
equation etc. does not need an indent, either.

Subsequent paragraphs, however, are indented.

\subsubsection{Sample Heading (Third Level)} Only two levels of
headings should be numbered. Lower level headings remain unnumbered;
they are formatted as run-in headings.

\paragraph{Sample Heading (Fourth Level)}
The contribution should contain no more than four levels of
headings. Table~\ref{tab1} gives a summary of all heading levels.

\begin{table}
\caption{Table captions should be placed above the
tables.}\label{tab1}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Heading level &  Example & Font size and style\\
\hline
Title (centered) &  {\Large\bfseries Lecture Notes} & 14 point, bold\\
1st-level heading &  {\large\bfseries 1 Introduction} & 12 point, bold\\
2nd-level heading & {\bfseries 2.1 Printing Area} & 10 point, bold\\
3rd-level heading & {\bfseries Run-in Heading in Bold.} Text follows & 10 point, bold\\
4th-level heading & {\itshape Lowest Level Heading.} Text follows & 10 point, italic\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\noindent Displayed equations are centered and set on a separate
line.
\begin{equation}
x + y = z
\end{equation}
Please try to avoid rasterized images for line-art diagrams and
schemas. Whenever possible, use vector graphics instead (see
Fig.~\ref{fig1}).

\begin{theorem}
This is a sample theorem. The run-in heading is set in bold, while
the following text appears in italics. Definitions, lemmas,
propositions, and corollaries are styled the same way.

% 'remark', and 'example' are defined in the LLNCS documentclass as well.

\begin{proof}
Proofs, examples, and remarks have the initial word in italics,
while the following text appears in normal font.

For citations of references, we prefer the use of square brackets
and consecutive numbers. Citations using labels or the author/year
convention are also acceptable. The following bibliography provides
a sample reference list with entries for journal

%articles~\cite{ref_article1}, an LNCS chapter~\cite{ref_lncs1}, a
%book~\cite{ref_book1}, proceedings without editors~\cite{ref_proc1},
%and a homepage~\cite{ref_url1}. Multiple citations are grouped

%\cite{ref_article1,ref_book1,ref_proc1,ref_url1}.
